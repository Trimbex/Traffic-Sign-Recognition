# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition Web Deployment

This guide will help you deploy your trained traffic sign recognition model as a sleek web application using FastAPI.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Batch Script (Recommended for Windows)
```bash
# Double-click or run from command prompt
start_app.bat
```

### Option 2: Using PowerShell Script
```powershell
# Run from PowerShell
.\start_app.ps1
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install FastAPI dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart

# Start the application
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- **Classes**: 43 German traffic sign categories
- **Input**: 32x32 RGB images (auto-resized)
- **Output**: Class prediction with confidence percentage
- **File Support**: JPG, PNG, GIF (max 5MB)

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### POST /predict
Upload an image and get traffic sign prediction
- **Input**: Multipart form data with image file
- **Output**: JSON with prediction, class ID, and confidence

### GET /health
Check if the service is running and model is loaded
- **Output**: Service status and model availability

### GET /classes
Get all 43 traffic sign classes
- **Output**: Complete list of supported sign types

## 📱 How to Use

1. **Start the Application**: Run one of the startup scripts
2. **Open Browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:8000
3. **Upload Image**: Click or drag & drop a traffic sign image
4. **Get Results**: Click "Recognize Sign" to see the prediction
5. **View Confidence**: See the AI's confidence level with visual indicators

## 🎯 Supported Traffic Signs

The model can recognize 43 different German traffic sign types including:

**Speed Limits**: 20km/h, 30km/h, 50km/h, 60km/h, 70km/h, 80km/h, 100km/h, 120km/h
**Warning Signs**: Dangerous curves, bumpy road, slippery road, road narrows
**Prohibition Signs**: No passing, no entry, no vehicles, weight restrictions
**Mandatory Signs**: Keep right/left, roundabout mandatory, ahead only
**Priority Signs**: Priority road, yield, stop, right-of-way at intersection

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found Error
- Ensure `custom_model.keras` is in the same directory as `app.py`
- Check that the model file isn't corrupted

### Dependencies Missing
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual environment
- Make sure you're using the correct Python environment

### Port Already in Use
- Change the port in the startup script: `--port 8001`
- Or kill the process using port 8000

### Python Environment Issues
- Make sure Python is properly installed and accessible via `python` command
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The application runs on localhost by default (secure for local use)
- File uploads are validated for type and size
- No data is stored permanently on the server
- All processing happens in memory

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:
- Using a proper WSGI server like Gunicorn
- Adding HTTPS/SSL certificates
- Implementing rate limiting
- Adding authentication if needed
- Using a reverse proxy like Nginx

## 📈 Performance

- **Model Loading**: ~2-3 seconds on startup
- **Prediction Time**: ~100-300ms per image
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB-1GB depending on model size
- **Concurrent Users**: Supports multiple simultaneous predictions

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure the model file is present and valid
4. Try restarting the application

Enjoy your AI-powered traffic sign recognition web app! 🎉
